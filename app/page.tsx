          <h2>What Is Laser Cleaning?</h2>
          <p>
            Laser cleaning is a cutting-edge, eco-friendly surface preparation method that
            uses focused laser light to vaporize rust, paint, oil, carbon, and other
            contaminants from metal, stone, or composite surfaces â€” without the need for
            chemicals, abrasives, or media blasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike traditional sandblasting or solvent cleaning, laser cleaning is
            non-contact and precise, leaving the underlying material untouched. Itâ€™s ideal
            for industrial maintenance, automotive restoration, mold cleaning, and historic
            preservation.
